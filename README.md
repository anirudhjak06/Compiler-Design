# Compiler-Design

A compiler translates the code written in one language to some other language without changing the meaning of the program. Compiler design principles provide an in-depth view of translation and optimization process. Compiler design covers basic translation mechanism and error detection and recovery. It includes lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis as front end and code generation and optimization as back-end.
