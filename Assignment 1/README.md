# _**Assignment Statement**_

Given a English passage (let us say an essay). The output should be the same essay but which is well formatted. 
Well Formatted means.  Beginning of a sentence should be a capital letter (except when it is a "literal").  Date should be formatted as September 2, 2021. For example you might get date as 2-9-21 or 2nd Sept 2021 or like Sept 2nd (year is missing). When year is missing assume that it is current year.  Year cannot be greater than 2021 (the current year). Use this to appropriately convert, for eg., 10th Oct 69 to October 10, 1969. 

Paragraph has to begin with a tab. Before paragraph their should be an empty line (not many empty lines, but only one empty line).

Write a LEX program to the above.
